    My name is Pedro Zurita and I am a developer in Brownsville, TX.
    I enjoy design in almost every aspect, from architecture to digital graphics. 
    As my primary passtimes I enjoy time with my wife and daughter and also build Arduino projects.
</p>
    <h1>My Background</h1>
<p>
    I graduated from Kaplan College as a Medical Assistant after which I started working at a local hospital as a nurse assistant. 
    My career progressed and I became the unit clerk of the Telemetry Unit where my involvement with electronic medical record keeping
    lead me to investigate the technolgies used to build these EHR/EMR systems. I now currently attend Southern Careers Institute with a 
    focus in software development.

    <h1>Why I decided to learn programming</h1>
<p>
    I have always been interested in building things and design. My curiosity has led me to two of my favorite things: Industrial Design and 
    Architecture. These two disciplines though, require significant capital expenditure to see any of what is designed actually be BUILT. 
    Programming is the digital equivalent: Piece by piece, byte by byte, structures are built out of thin air and then, the final product becomes
    visible and functional. Considerations for function and end user interaction very closely resemble that of more physical products and this 
    greatly appeals to me.
